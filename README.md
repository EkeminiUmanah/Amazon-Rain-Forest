# Amazon-Rain-Forest


Rsnet algorithm is used in this project to label satellite image chips with different atmospheric conditions and the different classes of land cover/land use. For this Multi-class Multi-Label problem, some of the labels are from the following categories: Cloud Cover (clear, partly, cloudy, haze), Primary RainForest, Water (rivers, lakes), Habitation (large city, small homes), Agriculture, Roads etc.

The project was done on a kaggle python notebook. The metric used was fbeta. Rsnet model was used with an SGD optimizer, a learning rate of 0.01 and run for 25 epochs.
